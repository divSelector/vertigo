You board the shuttle, a sleek, metallic vessel, its cold surfaces reflecting the harsh lights of Nova Haven. The emblem of Orbitex Enterprises is emblazoned on the walls, a reminder of the world you are leaving behind. 

The hum of the engines grows louder as the shuttle detaches from the station, and your stomach churns with unease. Through the small window, you catch a final glimpse of the station that has been your home. 

Ahead lies the Orbital Research Facility, run by Vertico Corporationâ€”an entity once considered a rival, now your new overseer. The weight of uncertainty settles heavily on your shoulders.

The shuttle docks with a jolt at the intermediary station, a stark, utilitarian structure floating in the void. As the hatch opens, you're greeted by the sight of two security teams standing on opposite sides of the docking bay. 

Orbitex guards in their familiar blue uniforms flank one side, their faces stern and unyielding. Opposite them, Vertico enforcers in sharp, black attire stand equally rigid. The air is thick with tension, like a cold war standoff. 

You step forward, feeling the eyes of both teams on you. The Orbitex commander hands over a data pad to his Vertico counterpart, and you realize there is no turning back.

The Vertico commander frowns as he scans the data pad. "This can't be right," he mutters, his eyes narrowing. "We're paying too much for this transfer." He glances up, suspicion etched across his face.

The Orbitex commander holds his ground, expression unwavering. "Those are the terms we were given," he replies firmly. "You'll find everything is in order."

A tense silence hangs in the air. You have the opportunity to speak.

- "Is there a problem with my transfer?"
- "Perhaps there's been a clerical error."
- "I assure you, I'm worth every credit."
- "Is this how Vertico always handles business?"
- Remain silent.

- The Vertico commander glances at you, then back at the Orbitex commander. After a brief pause, he shakes his head.
- The Vertico commander considers your words before nodding slightly.
- The Vertico commander raises an eyebrow, then gives a grudging nod.
- The Vertico commander frowns, but after a moment, he seems to dismiss the comment and focuses back on the data pad.

"Fine. We'll proceed." He signals to his team, and they part to make way for you.

Feeling like a captive, you walk toward the next shuttle, the Vertico guards falling into step behind you.
